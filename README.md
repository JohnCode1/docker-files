## This is a repository for all of my docker files, I have used when using my homelab for learning.

### Prior to running any of these docker compose files I recommend reading the compose-file and checking the .env for variables needed to be entered.

### Most of the app's versions are set to a version I know will run for me, and I recommend using the app's documentation or What Up Docker to update after running first.

### If you use any of these dockerfiles and run into issues I recommend first checking out the app's documentation. Alternativetly you can also reach out to me via github
